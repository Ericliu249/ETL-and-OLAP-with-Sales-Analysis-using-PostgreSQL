## Introduction<br>

In this project, I expressed “complex” OLAP queries in SQL. The key point of the project is to observe a large gap between the complexity of expressing the type of such queries and that of evaluating them (such as writing Java programs to produce the same results). My mission (in addition to writing the SQL queries) is to consider the reasons for the gap (between the expression and evaluation of such queries) and how to narrow it.
